## MERN Stack
I was losing my mind with a real web application after several tutorials, so I built this project.

### Usage

You will need to set up a `/config/dev.js` file that has the following:

```
module.exports = {
    redirectDomain: 'http://localhost:3000',
    jwtKey: 'pickastring',
};

```
